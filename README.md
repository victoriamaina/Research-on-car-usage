# Research-on-car-usage


Autolib was an electric car sharing service company in France that was operational between 2011 and 2018. The company had three types of electric cars i.e., blue cars, Utilib cars and Utilib 1.4 cars. Blue cars were most popularly used. These cars were available during the week renters could pick up cars in one station then drop them off at their destination. The dataset used in this analysis allows us to understand various electric car usage patterns for the company. The available data contains usage information for various postal codes between January 2018 and June 2018.
 For this project, I decided to focus on two of the weekdays, Tuesday and Thursday, which are among the working days. Usage rates are generally higher during the weekdays thus focus was on the two days of the week. Below are the specific hypotheses of interest in this analysis:
Null Hypothesis - The null hypothesis is the amount of bluecars taken on Tuesday is greater or equal to that taken on Thursday
Alternate Hypothesis - The null hypothesis is the amount of bluecars taken on Tuesday is less or equal to that taken on Thursday
